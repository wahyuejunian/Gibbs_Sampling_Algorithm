# Gibbs_Sampling_Algorithm

Gibbs sampling or a Gibbs sampler is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for obtaining a sequence of observations which are approximated from a specified multivariate probability distribution, when direct sampling is difficult (Wikipedia)

This code is an example of applying Gibbs sampling algorithm to determine the epicenter of an earthquake
